# coordination_oru_ros
Multi-robot coordination package based on coordination_oru with ROS support. <br>
Simulation 1 : [Head-on collision avoidance case]Trajectory of Robot2 is spatially adjusted with Robot1 being treated as an obstacle. The spatially adjustments are coupled with temporal coordination routine.<br>
